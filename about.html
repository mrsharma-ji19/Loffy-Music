        <h2><b>What is music?</b></h2>
        <p  style="font-size: 18px;">
            Music is a pleasant sound which is a combination of melodies and harmony and which soothes you. <br>Music may also
            refer to the art of composing such pleasant sounds with the help of the various musical instruments. <br>A person
            who knows music is a Musician.
            <br><br>
            The music consists of Sargam, Ragas, Taals, etc. <br>Music is not only what is composed of men but also which exists
            in nature. Have you ever heard the sound of a waterfall or a flowing river? Could you hear music there? <br> Thus,
            everything in harmony has music. <br>Here, I would like to quote a line by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one of the
            greatest musicians, “The music is not in the notes, but in the silence between.”
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Importance of music</strong></h2>
    
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            Music has great qualities of healing a person emotionally and mentally. <br>Music is a form of meditation. While
            composing or listening music ones tends to forget all his worries, sorrows and pains. <br> But,<br> in order to
            appreciate good music, we need to cultivate our musical taste. <br> It can be cited that in the Dwapar Yug, <br> the Gopis
            would get mesmerized with the music that flowed from Lord Krishna’s flute. <br> They would surrender themselves to
            Him. Also,<br> the research has proved that the plants which hear the Music grow at a faster rate in comparison to
            the others.

        <h2><strong>Magical Power Of Music</strong></h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            It has the power to cure diseases such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, etc. <br> The power of Music can be
            testified by the legends about Tansen of his bringing the rains by singing Raag Megh Malhar and lighting lamps
            by Raga Deepak. <br>
            It also helps in improving the concentration and is thus of great help to the students.

        <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            Music is the essence of life. Everything that has rhythm has music. <br> Our breathing also has a rhythm. <br> Thus, we
            can say that there is music in every human being or a living creature. <br> Music has the ability to convey all sorts
            of emotions to people. <br> Music is also a very powerful means to connect with God. <br> We can conclude that Music is
            the purest form of worship of God and to connect with our soul.
