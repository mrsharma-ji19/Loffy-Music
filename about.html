        <h2><b>What is music?</b></h2>
        <p  style="font-size: 18px;">
            Music is a pleasant sound which is a combination of melodies and harmony and which soothes you. <br>Music may also
            refer to the art of composing such pleasant sounds with the help of the various musical instruments. <br>A person
            who knows music is a Musician.
            <br><br>
            The music consists of Sargam, Ragas, Taals, etc. <br>Music is not only what is composed of men but also which exists
            in nature. Have you ever heard the sound of a waterfall or a flowing river? Could you hear music there? <br> Thus,
            everything in harmony has music. <br>Here, I would like to quote a line by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one of the
            greatest musicians, “The music is not in the notes, but in the silence between.”
        </p>

        <h2><strong>Importance of music</strong></h2>
    
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            Music has great qualities of healing a person emotionally and mentally. Music is a form of meditation. While
            composing or listening music ones tends to forget all his worries, sorrows and pains. But, in order to
            appreciate good music, we need to cultivate our musical taste. It can be cited that in the Dwapar Yug, the Gopis
            would get mesmerized with the music that flowed from Lord Krishna’s flute. They would surrender themselves to
            Him. Also, the research has proved that the plants which hear the Music grow at a faster rate in comparison to
            the others.

        <h2><strong>Magical Power Of Music</strong></h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            It has the power to cure diseases such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, etc. The power of Music can be
            testified by the legends about Tansen of his bringing the rains by singing Raag Megh Malhar and lighting lamps
            by Raga Deepak. It also helps in improving the concentration and is thus of great help to the students.

        <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">
            Music is the essence of life. Everything that has rhythm has music. Our breathing also has a rhythm. Thus, we
            can say that there is music in every human being or a living creature. Music has the ability to convey all sorts
            of emotions to people. Music is also a very powerful means to connect with God. We can conclude that Music is
            the purest form of worship of God and to connect with our soul.
